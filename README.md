## What Each Sample Demonstrates

All samples include comprehensive examples of:

### ToolBox API Integration
âœ… Connection management with real-time updates  
âœ… Notification system (success, info, warning, error)  
âœ… Clipboard operations  
âœ… File save/load dialogs  
âœ… Theme detection (light/dark)  
âœ… Terminal creation and command execution

## Sample Comparison

| Feature | HTML | React | Vue | Svelte |
|---------|------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Bundle Size** | ~50KB | ~155KB | ~72KB | ~42KB |
| **Runtime Overhead** | Minimal | Medium | Medium | Minimal |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy | Moderate | Easy | Easy |
| **TypeScript Support** | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Build Time** | Fast | Fast | Fast | Fast |
| **HMR Support** | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Ecosystem** | Standard Web | Large | Large | Growing |

*Bundle sizes are approximate and include all sample features*

## Development Workflow

### Development Mode (React/Vue/Svelte only)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts development server with hot module replacement. Note: ToolBox APIs are only available when loaded within the application.

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates optimized production build in `dist/` directory.

### Type Checking
All samples include TypeScript for type safety:
```bash
# React/Vue/Svelte
npm run check  # or tsc for HTML

# Shows type errors without building
```

## Project Structure

Each sample follows a consistent structure:

```
[framework]-sample/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # UI components (React/Vue/Svelte)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/           # Custom hooks (React)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composables/     # Composables (Vue)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/             # Utilities and stores (Svelte)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.[ts|js]  # Vite configuration (React/Vue/Svelte)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Entry point
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Sample-specific documentation
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript errors during build  
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### API Not Available
**Problem**: `window.toolboxAPI` is undefined  
**Solution**: The tool must be loaded within Power Platform Tool Box, not a standalone browser

### Connection Null
**Problem**: Connection is always null  
**Solution**: Create a connection in Power Platform Tool Box first

### HMR Not Working
**Problem**: Changes don't reflect immediately  
**Solution**: Restart dev server with `npm run dev`
