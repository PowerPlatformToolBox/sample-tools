### 4. Svelte Sample (`svelte-sample/`)
**Technology**: Svelte 5, TypeScript, Vite

A Svelte application leveraging Svelte's compiler-based reactivity.

**Key Features**:

## What Each Sample Demonstrates

All samples include comprehensive examples of:

### ToolBox API Integration
✅ Connection management with real-time updates  
✅ Notification system (success, info, warning, error)  
✅ Clipboard operations  
✅ File save/load dialogs  
✅ Theme detection (light/dark)  
✅ Terminal creation and command execution  
✅ Event subscription and handling  

### Dataverse API Integration
✅ FetchXML query execution  
✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
✅ Entity metadata retrieval  
✅ Error handling and validation  

### Development Best Practices
✅ TypeScript with full type safety (`@pptb/types`)  
✅ Modern build tooling (Vite)  
✅ Component-based architecture  
✅ State management patterns  
✅ Event-driven architecture  
✅ Responsive UI design  
✅ Production-ready builds  

### Build Configuration for PPTB Compatibility

Framework samples (React, Vue, Svelte) use Vite with special configuration for PPTB:

✅ **IIFE Format**: Builds use Immediately Invoked Function Expression instead of ES modules for compatibility with PPTB's iframe loading mechanism  
✅ **Single Bundle**: All code and CSS bundled into one file to avoid module loading issues  
✅ **HTML Optimization**: Custom plugin removes `type="module"` and `crossorigin` attributes for proper loading with `file://` URLs  
✅ **No External Dependencies**: All dependencies bundled together for standalone execution

   cd sample/[html|react|vue|svelte]-sample
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the sample**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Install in Power Platform Tool Box**:
   - Open Power Platform Tool Box
   - Go to Tools section
   - Click "Install Tool"
   - Enter the path to the built sample directory

## Choosing the Right Framework

### Choose **HTML/TypeScript** if you:
- Want minimal dependencies
- Need the smallest possible bundle size
- Are building a simple utility tool
- Want to learn the API without framework complexity

### Choose **React** if you:
- Need rich, complex user interfaces
- Want to leverage the React ecosystem
- Are familiar with React patterns
- Need extensive third-party component libraries

### Choose **Vue** if you:
- Want a progressive framework
- Prefer template-based syntax
- Need strong TypeScript support
- Want excellent documentation and tooling

### Choose **Svelte** if you:
- Want the smallest runtime bundle
- Need maximum performance
- Prefer compiler-based reactivity
- Want minimal boilerplate code

## Sample Comparison

| Feature | HTML | React | Vue | Svelte |
|---------|------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Bundle Size** | ~50KB | ~158KB | ~77KB | ~45KB |
| **Runtime Overhead** | Minimal | Medium | Medium | Minimal |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy | Moderate | Easy | Easy |
| **TypeScript Support** | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Build Time** | Fast | Fast | Fast | Fast |
| **HMR Support** | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Ecosystem** | Standard Web | Large | Large | Growing |

*Bundle sizes for HTML sample include compiled TypeScript; framework samples are IIFE bundles with all features included*

---

## Development Workflow

### Development Mode (React/Vue/Svelte only)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts development server with hot module replacement. Note: ToolBox APIs are only available when loaded within the application.

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates optimized production build in `dist/` directory.

### Type Checking
All samples include TypeScript for type safety:
```bash
# React/Vue/Svelte
npm run check  # or tsc for HTML

# Shows type errors without building
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript errors during build  
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### API Not Available
**Problem**: `window.toolboxAPI` is undefined  
**Solution**: The tool must be loaded within Power Platform Tool Box, not a standalone browser

### Connection Null
**Problem**: Connection is always null  
**Solution**: Create a connection in Power Platform Tool Box first

### HMR Not Working
**Problem**: Changes don't reflect immediately  
**Solution**: Restart dev server with `npm run dev`
